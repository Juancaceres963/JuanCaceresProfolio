    subtitle:
      "Internal application for efficient management of work records, clients, motorcycles, employees, and automated budget generation",
    mainImage: projImg1,
    tags: ["AppSheet", "Google Sheets", "Automation", "Workshop"],
    problem:
      "The workshop owner faced the need to modernize operations, as all records were previously kept only on paper. This made it difficult to track clients, motorcycles, and services performed, led to errors in billing calculations, and complicated employee task management. A centralized, simple, and accessible solution was needed to digitize daily operations, automate budget creation, and improve overall business organization.",
    role: "I designed the data structure, configured AppSheet, implemented automation using bots to generate PDFs, and organized the information in an intuitive way.",

      "Google AppSheet",
      "Google Sheets",
      "Workflow Bots",

    approach:
      "I used Google Sheets as a simulated relational database and AppSheet to build forms, record views, and custom actions.",
    challenges:
      "The main challenge was designing a logic system that allowed reuse of previously entered data (existing clients) and automating PDF generation based on specific conditions.",
    learning:
      "I improved my ability to work with no-code tools by applying declarative logic, conditional structures, and a smooth user experience.",
    status: "In production, currently used by the workshop",
    outcome:
      "Reduced management time, improved internal organization, and systematized a more efficient workflow for the business.",
